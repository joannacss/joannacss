	- Since I gradauted earlier than expected, I ended being the **1st alumni** in CE at UFS.

   - A Quadratic Equation Calculator written in ILA - a language that had a pseudocode syntax that resembled with Portuguese
- 🎸 I play **guitar**    (not so regularly due to limited free time)
   - Learned to play when I was 12 years old
- 🥁 I am learning to play drums
