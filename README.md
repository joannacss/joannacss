## Fun Facts about Me ⚡
- Since I graduated one semester earlier in Computer Engineering at UFS, I graduated alone and named the class of 2013 as ``Null''.
- I was the **1st alumni in Computer Engineering** at UFS, effectively making me the first Computer Engineer graduated in the state of Sergipe (Brazil)
- I skipped one grade when I was 6 years old (that's why I was usually the youngest student in school/college).
- I wrote my first program when I was 13 years old (a Quadratic Equation Calculator written in ILA - a language that had a pseudocode syntax that resembled with Portuguese)
- I play guitar 🎸 (started to learn when I was around 12 years old)
- I was part of a [band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHqs8XlOXfo) while in middle/high school
