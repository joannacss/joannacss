## Fun Facts about Me (aka, things you would not see on my CV)⚡
- 👩‍🎓 I joined the Computer Engineering program at Federal University of Sergipe (UFS) in 2009 (the year it was created). Since I finished all courses **one semester earlier**, I graduated **alone** (i.e., the 2009 "class" was just me lol).
	- I named the "class" of 2013 as `Null` (it made sense back then haha).
	- Since I graduated earlier than expected, I ended being the **1st alumni** from the CE program at UFS.
- 🎒I **skipped** one grade when I was 6 years old 
   - That's why I was usually the youngest student in school/college
- 🖥️ I wrote my **first program** when I was 13 years old (or 12? don't quite remember the exact year!)
   - A Quadratic Equation Calculator written in ILA - a language that had a pseudocode syntax that resembled with Portuguese
- 🎸 I play **guitar**    (not so regularly due to limited free time)
   - Learned to play when I was 12 years old
- 🥁 I am learning to play drums 
   - to be fair, I am being quite unable to regularly practice it given the sheer amount of work these days 
- 🎵 I was part of a [pop/rock band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHqs8XlOXfo) while in middle/high school 
   - I even did a cover of Avril Lavigne in 2008
- 🎮 Minecraft is my favorite computer game
- 🥋 I trained Krav Maga for two years
